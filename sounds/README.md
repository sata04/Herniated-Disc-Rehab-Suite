# Sound Files

This directory should contain the following sound files used by the application:

- `start.wav` - Played when an exercise session starts
- `end.wav` - Played when a single set completes
- `allend.wav` - Played when all exercise sets are completed

## Missing Files

If these files are missing, the application will use a silent audio file as a fallback. To add proper sound files:

1. Create or obtain appropriate WAV files for each sound effect
2. Name them exactly as listed above
3. Place them in this directory

## Format Requirements

- File format: WAV
- Recommended duration: 1-2 seconds
- Recommended sample rate: 44100Hz
- Recommended bit depth: 16-bit
